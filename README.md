Qubes OS Community-Developed Feature Tracker
============================================

The Community-Developed Feature Tracker has moved into the [qubes-issues](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues) issue tracker!

All of the issues that used to be tracked here are now conveniently available by [viewing all open `community-dev` issues](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acommunity-dev).

You can see the status of each issue by looking at the `S:` (status) labels.
For example:

* [`S: partial`](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acommunity-dev+label%3A%22S%3A+partial%22)
* [`S: in progress`](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acommunity-dev+label%3A%22S%3A+in+progress%22)
* [`S: under review`](https://github.com/QubesOS/qubes-issues/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Acommunity-dev+label%3A%22S%3A+under+review%22)

(You can read a more detailed description of each of these statuses by hovering over the label in the issue tracker itself.)

At the top of each issue, you can also find relevant information, like the **Community Dev** who is working on that issue, a link to the **PoC** (if any), and a link to the **Discussion** thread.
